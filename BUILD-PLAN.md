# Horizon restart — saved task checkpoints

The requested result is one complete, connected hydrology map of a closed
planet. Every stage works on the entire planet. No bounded trial regions.
Detailed terrain, vegetation and the old explorer are excluded from the new app.

1. **Global solver — completed.** `planet.mjs` implements the full spherical
   drainage model. `planet-worker.mjs` computes it off the UI thread.
   `tests/planet.test.mjs` passes eight tests covering the full default planet,
   connected ocean, reciprocal longitude/polar topology, pond/lake outlets,
   compact network coverage, runoff/area conservation and seed determinism.
   Default: 1,179,650 cells, 10,342 headwaters, 14,014 stream reaches,
   1,734 river reaches, 320 ponds, 324 lakes, 2,345 ocean mouths.
   No unresolved inland terminals, cycles or uphill links.
2. **Hydrology map — in progress.** The new standalone atlas has been built
   locally. Its visual output needs correction and review before publication.
3. **Inspection and touch controls — pending.** Check tracing to ocean,
   catchment highlighting, map/globe navigation and responsive layout.
4. **Replace the live main page — pending.** Publish the checked hydrology-only
   app at the existing GitHub Pages URL, removing retired active source.

This first checkpoint saves the solver and tests. It does not replace the
existing published 0.3.1 page yet. Old source remains until the new atlas is ready.

## World contract

A fictional closed planet, radius 64 km (128 km diameter), 402.124 km
circumference, 51,471.854 km² surface. The staggered triangular grid has
1,536 × 768 cells plus two unique polar nodes. Equatorial spacing is 261.8 m;
latitude cell areas integrate the spherical surface. Zooming never changes
the solved network. The grid resolution is explicit; subcell waterways are
not represented.

The largest connected below-sea-level component is the ocean. Priority-Flood
resolves every inland cell to its lowest escape level. Enclosed depressions
retain flat water surfaces and one spill outlet each. Ponds have mapped area
below 0.35 km²; larger waterbodies are lakes. Annual rainfall produces steady
runoff (coefficient 0.58), accumulated globally without tile boundaries. Lake
inputs and outflows balance. All retained basins are overflowing in this
steady-flow model; evaporation, seasonal drying and groundwater are not modeled.

Algorithm background: Barnes, Lehman & Mulla (2014),
[Priority-Flood](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.024).
The implementation is original and uses the closed spherical mesh.

Run the completed solver checks with:

```sh
node --test tests/planet.test.mjs
